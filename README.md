**React Todo App**
This project is a simple React-based Todo application with the following features:

**Header Component**: Displays the title of the application. The title is customizable and passed as a prop to the Header component.

**TodoList Component**: Displays a dynamic list of tasks. Each task is represented as a separate component (TodoItem). The TodoList component receives an array of tasks as a prop.

**TodoItem Component**: Represents an individual task. Each TodoItem displays the task content and has a checkbox to mark the task as completed. Implements a function to toggle the completion status when the checkbox is clicked.

**State Management**: Utilizes React hooks (useState) for state management. The completion status of each task is stored in the state and updated dynamically when the user interacts with the checkboxes.

**Styling**: Basic styling is applied using CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the user interface. Styles include background colors, padding, box shadows, and text decorations.

**Bonus Features**:

**Task deletion**: Implemented using a delete button in each TodoItem.
**Filtering tasks** based on completion status.
**Adding new tasks** dynamically.
